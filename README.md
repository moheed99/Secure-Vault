### ✨ **Core Features**

* **🔐 Advanced Authentication System:** Secure user registration and login using the industry-standard **PBKDF2 algorithm** with a unique salt for every user, ensuring robust password protection.
* **🛡️ End-to-End Encrypted Data Vault:** A "**Secret Note**" feature where user data is **encrypted on the client-side using AES-GCM** before being stored. This ensures that sensitive information remains confidential and tamper-proof at all times.
* **🤖 AI-Powered Threat Analysis:** Leveraging the **Google Gemini API**, this feature allows users to paste any text (emails, URLs, code snippets) to receive an instant security analysis. The AI identifies potential threats like phishing or malware and provides a summary, severity level, and actionable recommendations.
* **✍️ Secure User and File Management:** Includes secure profile updates, a "**Change Password**" function with current password verification, and a simulated secure file upload system with **strict client-side validation** for file types and size.
* **📜 Comprehensive Audit Trail:** An **immutable Activity Log** records all significant user actions—from login attempts to data encryption—providing a clear and transparent security log for the user.
