# Secure-Vault
Welcome to Secure FinTech Vault, a sophisticated web application designed to showcase modern cybersecurity best practices in a hands-on, interactive environment. This project provides a personal digital vault where users can manage their profile, store sensitive information securely, and analyze potential digital threats.
It is built for developers and security enthusiasts who want to see fundamental security principles and advanced AI capabilities working together in a practical application.
Core Features
🔐 Advanced Authentication System: Secure user registration and login using the industry-standard PBKDF2 algorithm with a unique salt for every user, ensuring robust password protection.
🛡️ End-to-End Encrypted Data Vault: A "Secret Note" feature where user data is encrypted on the client-side using AES-GCM before being stored. This ensures that sensitive information remains confidential and tamper-proof at all times.
🤖 AI-Powered Threat Analysis: Leveraging the Google Gemini API, this feature allows users to paste any text (emails, URLs, code snippets) to receive an instant security analysis. The AI identifies potential threats like phishing or malware and provides a summary, severity level, and actionable recommendations.
✍️ Secure User and File Management: Includes secure profile updates, a "Change Password" function with current password verification, and a simulated secure file upload system with strict client-side validation for file types and size.
📜 Comprehensive Audit Trail: An immutable Activity Log records all significant user actions—from login attempts to data encryption—providing a clear and transparent security log for the user.
